# HW1_CHEM179
Welcome to Zhi Gong`s HW1 CHEM179, a dedicated effort to contribute to the HOMEWORK1 through innovative coding. We recognize the importance of protecting intellectual property rights and hereby inform all users and contributors of the copyright terms governing the use of our source code.

I am deeply grateful to my teachers and teaching assistants for their selfless dedication and patient guidance, which have not only imparted knowledge but also led me on the path to success.

But there is still something needed to be paid more attentions. Although q1`s solution is quite perfectly manifested, the final result of Problem 2 is performed within the compiler terminal, and the calculations are very drop-dead accurate, even more so than the sample accuracy, which made me so proud. The problem 3, optimization for codes, is with respect to the steepest descent. In this question, I made it with a reference website:https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_35338624/article/details/100981729. 

More for the 4th part, I have exerted every effort to enhance the code's readability, modularity, and ease of modification. The documentation is replete with evidence of my ongoing revisions and enhancements, including numerous comments on adjustments that are no longer active. To ensure a smooth testing experience, I urge you to carefully check the file paths, ensuring they are correctly formatted and located, especially those not in English. Without this precaution, I regret to say that I cannot assure a satisfactory experience.
